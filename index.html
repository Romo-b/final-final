	This versatility empowers designers to employ Kanit across a wide spectrum of design projects.

  			<p class="bc1">Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled amidst rolling hills, there lived three little pigs.
				These pigs were known throughout the land not just for their adorable snouts and curly tails, but also for their unique love of typography.
				Each pig had a distinct taste when it came to the typefaces they used for their creative endeavors.
				The first little pig, Penelope, had a fondness for the clean and modern look of "Kanit."
				She would diligently create her posters and flyers for the annual village fair using the sleek and legible Kanit typeface.
				Her invitations were so polished that they attracted visitors from far and wide.</p>
	</div>
<hr>	
	<div class="column2">
			<p class="bc2">The second little pig, Quincy, preferred a more playful and whimsical typeface, so he often used "Comic Sans" in his design projects.
					His storytelling illustrations featuring the three little pigs always had a touch of childlike innocence to them, which made them a hit among the village children.</p>
				</div>
<hr>
				<div class="column3">
			<p class="bc3">The third little pig, Rupert, had an eye for classic elegance and opted for "Baskerville" when he crafted the village's official documents.
					His impeccable choice conveyed authority and tradition, ensuring that all village proclamations were taken seriously by both the pig and human residents.</p>
				</div>
<hr>
				<div class="column4">
			<p class="bc4">Despite their differing typographic tastes, these three little pigs were not just masters of design but also masters of their craft.
					They knew that the right typeface, whether it was "Kanit," "Comic Sans," or "Baskerville," could make all the difference in the world of visual communication.
					And so, they lived happily ever after, their creativity celebrated far and wide, their village a shining example of artistic diversity.</p>
